# It's recommended to start with an *empty* config and only add sections and options as needed - all variables have reasonable defaults.

# GyroNormalizationFactor controls how quickly gyro drift is accounted for
# Default value of 50 should be good in 99%+ of cases, but rarely one may want to tweak it

# NunchuckStickCalibration is neutral x, y and minimal max offset from neutral x,y
